Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adarsh.

I'm a Data Scientist with 4 years of experience driving business impact through data analytics, machine learning, and automation. Currently based in London, UK.

I'm passionate about turning data into actionable insights and building tools that make data accessible to everyone. My expertise spans Python, SQL, machine learning, and creating data visualization tools that help teams make better decisions.

When I'm not diving into datasets, you'll find me exploring new technologies, writing about data science concepts, or working on side projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with data.
